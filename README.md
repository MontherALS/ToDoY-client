# MVP ToDo (TypeScript)

> My **first real TypeScript project** â€” a simple fullstack **To-Do app** to learn TypeScript in action.  
> The goal: practice both **frontend + backend** with TS while building something useful.

---

## What is this project?
A **basic but complete To-Do app (MVP)**:  
- **Frontend** â†’ Next.js + React + Tailwind + TypeScript  
- **Backend** â†’ Express + TypeScript + MongoDB + JWT Authentication  
- **Database** â†’ MongoDB (Mongoose)

It was built mainly as a **learning project** to understand TypeScript better, not to be perfect.
